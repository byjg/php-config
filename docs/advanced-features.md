# Advanced Features

## Caching Configuration

The library supports caching of configuration values to improve performance, especially in production environments where configuration rarely changes.

### Cache Modes

The `Environment` constructor accepts a PSR-16 compatible cache implementation and a cache mode:

```php
<?php
use ByJG\Config\CacheModeEnum;
use ByJG\Config\Environment;
use ByJG\Cache\Psr16\FileSystemCacheEngine;

// Using file system cache with the environment
$cache = new FileSystemCacheEngine('/path/to/cache');
$prod = new Environment(
    'prod', 
    ['dev'], 
    $cache,
    false,
    false,
    CacheModeEnum::singleFile
);
```

There are two cache modes available:

| Mode                           | Description                                           |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `CacheModeEnum::multipleFiles` | Each configuration key is cached separately (default) |
| `CacheModeEnum::singleFile`    | All configuration keys are cached as a single entry   |

#### When to use each cache mode:

- **Multiple Files**: Better when you have many configuration entries that change independently
- **Single File**: Better performance when loading the entire configuration at once and when changes are infrequent

### Compatible Cache Implementations

You can use any PSR-16 compatible cache implementation. The library works well with:

- [byjg/cache-engine](https://github.com/byjg/cache-engine)
- Any other PSR-16 implementation

## Abstract and Final Environments

The Environment constructor supports two special flags:

```php
<?php
use ByJG\Config\Environment;

// Abstract environment (cannot be loaded directly)
$baseConfig = new Environment('base', [], null, true, false);

// Final environment (cannot be inherited from)
$secureConfig = new Environment('secure', [], null, false, true);
```

### Abstract Environments

Abstract environments (`$abstract = true`) cannot be loaded directly but can be inherited by other environments. This is useful for creating base configurations that should never be used on their own.

If you try to build a container with an abstract environment, it will throw an exception.

### Final Environments

Final environments (`$final = true`) cannot be inherited by other environments. This is useful for sensitive configurations that should not be extended.

If you try to create an environment that inherits from a final environment, it will throw an exception.

## Extended Container Features

The `Container` class implements both PSR-11's `ContainerInterface` and the library's own `ContainerInterfaceExtended`, which provides additional methods:

```php
<?php
// Standard PSR-11 methods
$value = $container->get('key');
$exists = $container->has('key');

// Extended methods
$rawValue = $container->raw('key'); // Get the raw value without processing
$keyStatus = $container->keyStatus('key'); // Check the status of a key
```

### Key Status

The `keyStatus()` method returns a `KeyStatusEnum` value that provides information about the status of a key:

| Status                     | Description                                                                    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `KeyStatusEnum::NOT_FOUND` | The key does not exist in the container                                        |
| `KeyStatusEnum::STATIC`    | The key exists and has a static value                                          |
| `KeyStatusEnum::IN_MEMORY` | The key exists, is an instance, and is currently loaded in memory              |
| `KeyStatusEnum::WAS_USED`  | The key exists, is an instance, was previously used but is no longer in memory |
| `KeyStatusEnum::NOT_USED`  | The key exists, is an instance, but has not been used yet                      |

## Error Handling

The library uses exceptions to handle error conditions:

| Exception                     | When it occurs                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `NotFoundException`           | When a key is not found in the container       |
| `ContainerException`          | General container errors                       |
| `InvalidDefinitionException`  | When a definition is invalid                   |
| `InvalidEnvironmentException` | When an environment is not properly configured |

Example of handling container exceptions:

```php
<?php
use Psr\Container\NotFoundExceptionInterface;
use Psr\Container\ContainerExceptionInterface;

try {
    $value = $container->get('non_existent_key');
} catch (NotFoundExceptionInterface $e) {
    // Handle key not found
    error_log("Configuration key not found: " . $e->getMessage());
} catch (ContainerExceptionInterface $e) {
    // Handle other container errors
    error_log("Container error: " . $e->getMessage());
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching

Using caching is strongly recommended for production environments. It significantly reduces the overhead of reading and parsing configuration files on each request.

### Lazy Loading

The library uses lazy loading for configurations defined as closures and dependency injections. Values are only processed when they are requested, which improves performance.

### Environment Inheritance

While environment inheritance is powerful, excessive inheritance chains can impact performance. Try to keep inheritance hierarchies shallow.

### Singleton vs. Instance

Using `toSingleton()` for objects that are frequently accessed can improve performance by reusing the same instance.

## Advanced Environment Setup Example

Here's a comprehensive example of setting up a complex environment configuration:

```php
<?php
use ByJG\Config\Definition;
use ByJG\Config\Environment;
use ByJG\Config\CacheModeEnum;
use ByJG\Cache\Psr16\FileSystemCacheEngine;

// Create abstract base environment
$base = new Environment('base', [], null, true);

// Development environment inherits from base
$dev = new Environment('dev', ['base']);

// Staging environment with cache
$stagingCache = new FileSystemCacheEngine('/tmp/cache/staging');
$staging = new Environment(
    'staging', 
    ['dev'], 
    $stagingCache, 
    false, 
    false, 
    CacheModeEnum::multipleFiles
);

// Production environment with optimized cache
$prodCache = new FileSystemCacheEngine('/tmp/cache/prod');
$prod = new Environment(
    'prod', 
    ['staging'], 
    $prodCache, 
    false, 
    true, // Final environment
    CacheModeEnum::singleFile
);

// Create definition with all environments
$definition = (new Definition())
    ->withConfigVar('APP_ENV')
    ->addEnvironment($base)
    ->addEnvironment($dev)
    ->addEnvironment($staging)
    ->addEnvironment($prod);

// Build the container
$container = $definition->build();
```
